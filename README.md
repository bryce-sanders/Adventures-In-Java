# Overview - Student Information Collector

This project marks my very first venture into the use of the Java programming language. In completing this project, I have the opportunity, not only to learn a very marketable and widely used programming language, but also to demonstrate that I can pick up the basics of new coding languages quickly.

This program stores student information. It allows the user to enter the information of a new student and stores it in a file. When the program is closed and re-opened, the user can look up student information entered in the past.

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the latest version of Visual Studio Code to create this program.

This program is written in Java and makes use of Jackson, “the Java JSON library”, and Maven, a build automation tool that works with Java.

# Studied Resources

The following are sites that helped me learn to begin programming with Java.
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-print-colored-text-in-java-console/)
* [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-serialization-approaches)
* [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)

# Future Work

* The "Students" file store all information on one line. I will need to learn more about Jackson to fix this.
* The program does not check if a student already exists. I would like to add this in the future.
* I intended to create a "Semester" to store students registration information but I ran out of time. I would like to add this in the future as well.
