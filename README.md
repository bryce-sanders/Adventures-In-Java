# Overview - Student Information Collector

This project marks my very first venture into the use of the Java programming language. In completing this project, I have the opportunity, not only to learn a very marketable and widely used programming language, but also to demonstrate that I can pick up the basics of new coding languages quickly.

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
